# Activity Feature Requirements
This document outlines the requirements for the “Activity” feature, inspired by Slack, to be implemented in the XMARS application. 
The purpose of the feature is to give the user a feed with all the Workspace activity that might include mentions, threads, reactions to user’s messages and invitations.
